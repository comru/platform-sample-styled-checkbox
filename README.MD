# Styled Checkbox

This is a showcase application which is developed to demonstrate how to customize UI components:
  - The `StyledCheckBoxExample.java` sets HTML caption to component 
  - The `styled-checkbox-example.xml` screen displays new customized checkbox.

  - Click *Run* > *Start application* server

  - Go to `http://localhost:8080/app` and log in as `admin / admin`
  - Open *Application* > *Styled checkbox example*, try to turn on and turn off styled checkbox.
